# Less is mjór

Mjór is a new WASM runtime that is dedicated to running WASM programs in distributed environments (that is, running them on multiple machines). This project is very open ended: work with the mjór team to advance their codebase and implement new features. Depending on your skill level, this can include:

- Examples and tutorials
- Unit and integration tests
- Benchmarks and performance profiling
- Writing consensus algorithms (see Raft)
- Writing distributed databases on top of consensus algorithms
- Writing HTTP libraries for building web applications in WASM

If you are passionate about developer relations, performance optimization, distributed systems, or libraries for web applications, then this project has something for you.
